# Cellular Automata Orbs

A small side project of mine to learn more of the Rust Bevy engine. Similar to my [snake game](https://github.com/JB-it/bevy_snake) it is just a learning experience for myself.

The project is inspired by a project by the [Particle life](https://github.com/HackerPoet/Particle-Life) project by [HackerPoet (Code Parade)](https://github.com/HackerPoet)

## Usage

Download the repository and run it via
```bash
cargo run
```

To change any of the parameters, after downloading, edit the rules in the **get_attraction** method in the orbs.rs file.
